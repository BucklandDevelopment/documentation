- **CSI** – Camera Serial Interface, a hardware interface for connecting cameras to SoCs 
- **DHCP** – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, a network management protocol which dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network

- **Device Tree source (DTS)** – a human-readable source file to be compiled into a DTB
- **Device Tree blob (DTB)** – a binary file containing a Device Tree, the result of compiling DTS files.
- **`dt-blob.bin`** – a binary file containing initial GPIO configuration that is read by the firmware at boot time; despite the name, this is _not_ Device Tree blob (although it is compiled by the Device Tree tools)
- **DVI** – Digital Visual Interface, a video interface for connecting a source device to a monitor or display; electrically compatible with HDMI, so a simple adapter can convert from one to the other (excluding audio, which DVI does not support); see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface)
- **Firmware** – software that runs on a particular hardware device, for example a wireless chip or dongle; distinct from the usual software running on the Raspberry Pi in that it is usually a fixed binary blob of data that is loaded on to the device at startup; on the Raspberry Pi, the VC4 GPU requires firmware to be loaded to it at startup in order boot up and run the entire system.
- **GPIO** – General Purpose Input/Output, the programmable pins on the Raspberry Pi
- **GPU** – Graphical Processing Unit, a hardware device for handling graphical (and related) tasks at high speed; on the Raspberry Pi, this is called the VideoCore4 (VC4), and is built into the SoC.
- **HDMI**  High-Definition Multimedia Interface, a standard interface for transmitting uncompressed video and compressed or uncompressed audio data from a source device to a display device; see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI)
- **HDCP** – High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection, an optional encryption mechanism used for HDMI or DVI transmission; see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection)
- **HVS** – Hardware Video Scaler, a hardware block in the VC4 GPU on all Raspberry Pi models used for manipulating and displaying bitmaps
- **I<sup>2</sup>C** – Inter-Integrated Circuit (pronounced _I-squared-C_), an electrical protocol used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication; see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C)
- **I<sup>2</sup>S** – Inter-Integrated Circuit Sound, an electrical serial bus interface standard used for connecting digital audio devices together; see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S)
- **ISP** – Imaging System Pipeline, a set of hardware (and sometimes software) stages that processes images from a camera into a high-quality result; the Raspberry Pi has a built-in hardware ISP that processes images captured from a camera attached to the CSI port.
- **LED** – Light-Emitting Diode, a semiconductor device that produces light from electricity
- **Linux** – the main operating system used on the Raspberry Pi; the particular customised distribution for the Raspberry Pi range is called Raspbian; third parties have also produced their own distributions.
- **MSD** – Mass Storage Device (amongst other things), such as an SD card or hard disk drive
- **NAND** - a NAND gate is a logic gate, specifically an inverted AND gate; can also refer to a type of flash memory that uses NAND logic; see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate)
- **OTP** – One-Time Programmable, a type of memory that can only be programmed once, and retains the programmed data after power off; used for serial numbers etc.
- **Overlay** – a boot-time or run-time patch to a Device Tree allowing a degree of configuration by the user; see our [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md) for more details, or run `dtoverlay -a` in a terminal window for a list of available overlays
- **`raspi-config`** – a command line tool for configuring Raspbian's operating system features; see our [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md)
- **raspivid, raspistill, raspiyuv, raspividyuv** – a set of applications to run the Raspberry Pi Camera Module in various modes; see our [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md)
- **Raspberry Pi Configuration Tool (`rcgui`)** – a graphical equivalent of `raspi-config`
- **Raspberry Pi Desktop** – a version of the LXDE desktop environment, specifically tailored to the Raspberry Pi (used to be called Pixel)
- **SoC** – system on a chip, an integrated circuit that integrates all components of a computer
- **SPI** – Serial Peripheral Interface bus, a synchronous serial communication interface specification used for short distance communication
- **SSH** – Secure Shell, a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely over an unsecured network; see our [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md) or [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell)
- **TLA** – three-letter abbreviation; almost the entire reason for this glossary
- **TP1/TP2** – test points
- **UART** – Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter, a protocol for asynchronous serial communication in which the data format and transmission speeds are configurable
- **USB** – Universial Serial Bus; the main Raspberry Pi models have four USB sockets for connecting USB devices, for example, mice or keyboards; see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB)
- **VC4** – the VideoCore4 GPU used on the Raspberry Pi; contains a large number of hardware blocks that handle graphics, cameras, display, CODECs, etc.
- **VNC** – a graphical desktop sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol (RFB) to remotely control another computer; see our [official documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/vnc/README.md)
- **Volt (V)** – SI-derived unit for electrical potential difference.; see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volt)
- **`vcgencmd`** – a Raspberry Pi–specific tool for communicating with the VideoCore4 GPU
